## Arithmetic Operators
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulo/Remainder (%)

*Note:* Integer Division is truncated 
(truncated: everything after the decimal is removed)

*Ex:* `5/3 = 1.67` or  `22/6 = 3`

Be careful when doing this, `(double)(3.4) =0.0`
- Integer division is computed first before casting to `double`

The arithemetic operators also follow normal precedence rules (order of operations, or PEMDAS)

1. parantheses, from the inner ones out
2. *, /, %
3. +, -
